## About Me

I'm Nadia, I'm currently a case coordinator, but looking to switch to a role within tech with CFG.

I have one cat, named Tillie who I  love, and I also read a lot of books in my free time.

I am currently reading The Prison Healer which I'm really enjoying right now, and it's part of a trilogy series:

- The Priosn Healer
- The Gilded Cage
- The Blood Traitor  

My goal is to read 111 books in 2025 and I am at around 75 so far.
